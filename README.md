# Hitag-script
A script originally designed to download art of the Bakemonogatari character Hitagi Senjougahara.

With that being said, I have since designed it so that it can be used on virtually any character, assuming they have art.

This script searches Safebooru and Pixiv and downloads all art it finds.

## GENERAL CONFIG (both windows and linux)
Example `config.json` file
```
{
	"danbooru_name": "ruler_(fate/apocrypha)"
}
```

## Running the script (Linux)
`$ ./run.sh` in the project directory

## Running the script (Windows)
Ensure that you have installed Node.js 7.x from https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

run `run.bat` by either running it from a command prompt or double clicking it.
