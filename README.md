# Hitagi-script
A script originally designed to download art of the Bakemonogatari character Hitagi Senjougahara.

With that being said, I have since designed it so that it can be used on virtually any character, assuming they have art.

This script searches Safebooru and Pixiv and downloads all art it finds.

## Running the script (Linux)
Install Node.js 7.x through your package manager via https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

`$ ./run.sh` in the project directory and provide the safebooru tag(s) when prompted

## Running the script (Windows)
Ensure that you have installed Node.js 7.x from https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

run `run.bat` by either running it from a command prompt or double clicking it.
Provide the safebooru tag(s) when prompted
